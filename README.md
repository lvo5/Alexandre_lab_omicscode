## Purpose:
Multi-omics analyses are becoming the gold standards for answering systems-level biological questions in many model organism. However, acquiring the computational skillset required for omics analyses remains a challenge for many scientists who are not traditionally trained in bioinformatics. Here, we offer step-by-step guidelines and example codes for analyzing big transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and methylomics datasets. All example codes provided are made from **Python version 3.**

This guidelines will:


## Prerequisite:
This guideline assumes that the user is:
